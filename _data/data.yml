career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hardworking software development professional driven to increase team effectiveness. Focused on usability 
      and performance improvements. Experienced in communicating with clients and attending to their requests.
      
      So far, according to past performance reviews, some of my advantages are: availability, performance, 
      flexibility (multiple technologies), debugging/analysis and being effective when communicating.
      
      And one disadvantage is visibility, I have some trouble exposing my work, so outside of my teammates/managers, 
      it might seem I'm not performing as well as I actually am.

          With IntellectEU I adventured deeper into functional programming, which I was interested since university.

          Currently my tasks are:
            - As a Backend developer, add new features and correct bugs, both in daml side and integrations side. 
              This means I am working with both parts of the application from the backend and also handle communication between them.
